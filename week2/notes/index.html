    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>IF is a control structure used to make decisions. It works as follows, first an expression is evaluated, if it gives a positive result, the actions related to the positive case are performed.</li>
        <li>The FOR loop is used to repeat one or more instructions a specified number of times.</li>
        <li>WHILE These loops are used when we want to repeat the execution of some sentences an indefinite number of times, as long as a condition is met.</li>
        <li>A function is a series of instructions that we include within the same process. This process can then be run from any other site just by calling it.</li>
    </ul>
